GRUTinizer
==========

A generic unpacker and analysis package for gamma-ray spectroscopy.

The doxygen documentation can be found [here](https://pcbend.github.io/GRUTinizer).

Installation depends on choice of ROOT version.

If you are still using ROOT5, you should compile using the master branch.

If you are using ROOT6, you should compile on the root6 branch. Note that this has been tested on ROOT 6.06.08. ROOT should be installed from source, with python and mathmore features enabled.

Your mileage may vary on later versions. ROOT versions from ROOT6.08 to ROOT6.12 should compile, but will not behave exactly as expected. Particularly, if you compile on ROOT6.12, you can still use GRUTinizer but the GUI will not function correctly.
